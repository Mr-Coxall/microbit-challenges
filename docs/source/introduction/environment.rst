Setting Up Your Environment
****************************

Before you start coding, you will need a source code editor to be able to write, load and run programs on your micro:bit.
There are four main editors you can use: in-browser micro:bit editor_, beginner freindly Mu editor, a MicroPython application if you're
on a ChromeBook or just your regular Python editor to write Python files with a suite of command line commands (advanced).  

For the purposes of the following tutorials we will be using the Mu editor, but feel free to use whatever suits you better.
To download Mu, got to Mu website.

.. _editor: https://python.microbit.org
.. _website: https://codewith.mu/en/

You can choose different options to install Mu. The ones you'll most likely use is an installer for your device (Mac/Windows), or installation through
Python package (pip) using `command line interface`_, which will be useful to know for installation of Python libraries.

Once you have the editor installed, run it and plug micro:bit into your computer.
