Setting Up Your Environment
****************************

Before you start coding, you will need a source code editor to be able to write, load and run programs on your micro:bit.
There are four main editors you can use: in-browser micro:bit editor_, beginner freindly Mu editor, a MicroPython application if you're
on a ChromeBook or just your regular Python editor to write Python files with a suite of command line commands (advanced).  

For the purposes of the following tutorials we will be using the Mu editor, but feel free to use whatever suits you better.


.. _editor: https://python.microbit.org
.. _here: https://codewith.mu/en/

Once you have the editor installed, run it and plug micro:bit into your computer.
