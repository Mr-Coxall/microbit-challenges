This is 

This cipher, also called 'le chiffre indéchiffrable', was first described by Giovan Battista Belazzo. Although the concept is easy to understand, the cipher resisted 
breaking for three centuries, until Friedrich Kasiski introduced a succesful general attack.  

It works similarly to Caesar substitution cipher, since it's also based on shifting aplhabet positions. This time instead of shifting all letters 
by the same value, we choose a keyword which determines a different value for each letter in the plaintext.

As an example, suppose that this is our plaintext: ::
    
    ATTACKATDAWN

Then you choose a keyword (such as snake) and repeat it for each row of plaintext: ::

    SNAKESNAKESN

Then you use each letter of the key to determine the shift of every letter of the plaintext: ::

    Plaintext:  ATTACKATDAWN
    Key:        SNAKESNAKESN
    Ciphertext: SGTKGCNTNEOA

You can try deciphering and deciphering your own messages. If you're up for a challenge, try to decrypt this ciphertext enciphered using Vigenère cipher: ::

Here's what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about alcohol. It  says that  alcohol  is  a  colourless  volatile  liquid  formed  by  the  fermentation  of  sugars  
and  also  notes  its  intoxicating  effect  on  certain  carbon-­‐based  life  forms.

The  Hitchhiker's  Guide  to the  Galaxy  also  mentions  alcohol.  It  says  
that  the  best  drink  in  existence  is  the  Pan  Galactic  Gargle  Blaster.  It  says  that  the  effect  of  a  Pan  Galactic  Gargle  Blaster  is  like  having  
your  brains  smashed  out  by  a  slice  of  lemon  wrapped  round  a  large  gold  brick.  The  Guide  also  tells  you  on  which  planets  the  best  Pan  Galactic  
Gargle  Blasters  are  mixed,  how  much  you  can  expect  to  pay  for  one  and  what  voluntary  organizations  exist  to  help  you  rehabilitate  afterwards.

The  Hitchhiker's  Guide  to  the  Galaxy  sells  rather  better  than  the  Encyclopedia  Galactica.
