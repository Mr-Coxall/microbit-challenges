Micro:bit - Getting Started 
****************************

The BBC micro:bit is a programmable micro-computer - microcontroller - that can be used to create all kinds of projects from robots to musical instruments – 
the possibilities are endless. Let's take a look at the features that you can use in your designs:

 * 25 red LED lights that can flash messages.
 * Two programmable buttons (A and B) that can be used to tell the micro:bit when to start and stop things.
 * A thermistor to measure the temperature.
 * A light sensor to measure the change in light.
 * An accelerometer to detect motion.
 * A magnetometer to tell you which direction you’re heading in.
 * A radio and a Bluetooth Low Energy connection to interact with other devices.

You can program micro:bit using several languages: MicroPython, C++ or JavaScript. This tutorial will focus on programming micro:bit using
MicroPython, but if you already are familiar with Python, or you're looking for extra challenge, look at the section for :ref:`Programming Micro:bit Using Other laguages`. 
C/C++ might be useful in particular, as it's the main language used to program embedded devices.

MicroPython is a version of Python_ , that's designed to run on microcontrollers like micro:bit. Since their functionality is virtually the same (look here_ for difference 
in behaviour), we refer to the language used as Python in these tutorials. Programming in Python consists of
writing a series of steps to be executed (it's an *imperative* language), as you will see later when writing your first program.

Guide to the guide
===================

Sections in this tutorial will walk you through coding using micro:bit, basics of programming and micro:bit's features. Especially if you're a beginner,
you don't have to meticulously go through all the theory covered in Basics of programming. Start with writing simple programs using the features of micro:bit or
the examples and
read about more programming concepts as you go and according to what you need. Feel free to skip over the parts you are confident in and choose the parts that you need.

Topics covered here are generally only touched upon and many things are not explained on purpose. One of the important skills
you will need in the course and work later on will be reading the official documentation, which is why there are links to it all along the way. 

As you learn more about programming, you'll naturally keep finding better and more efficient ways to do your 
projects of the past, but right now you should focus on getting yourself started on small projects.  

.. note:: If you feel confused while reading through tutorials or if you feel like you need more guidance to start programming, don't be discouraged! There is a lot of free online courses that are great at going through basics of programming with Python, like this one_. Try to go through a first few lessons, and everything will make more sense.
