Setting Up Your Environment
****************************

Before you start coding, you will need a source code editor to be able to write, load and run programs on your micro:bit.
\There are four main options: 

    - in-browser micro:bit editor_ 
    - beginner friendly `Mu editor`_ 
    - MicroPython application if you're on a ChromeBook  
    - your regular Python editor to write Python files with a suite of command line commands (advanced).  

For the purposes of this tutorial we will be using the Mu editor, but feel free to use whatever suits you better.
To download Mu, got to Mu website.

.. _editor: https://python.microbit.org

You can choose different options to install Mu. The ones you'll most likely use is an installer for your device (Mac/Windows), or installation through
Python package (pip) using :ref:`command line interface` if you've installed Python. Using this method will be crucial for working with Python further, since it gives 
you an easy access to Python libraries (MicroPython does not support Python external libraries, since many are too large for an embedded device. However, a subset was
recreated for the `MicroPython ecosystem`_).

Once you have the editor installed, run it and plug micro:bit into your computer.
