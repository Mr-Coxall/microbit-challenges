Micro:bit - Getting Started 
****************************

The BBC micro:bit is a programmable micro-computer - microcontroller - that can be used to create all kinds of projects from robots to musical instruments – 
the possibilities are endless. Let's take a look at the features that you can use in your designs:

 * 25 red LED lights that can flash messages.
 * Two programmable buttons (A and B) that can be used to tell the micro:bit when to start and stop things.
 * A thermistor to measure the temperature.
 * A light sensor to measure the change in light.
 * An accelerometer to detect motion.
 * A magnetometer to tell you which direction you’re heading in.
 * A radio and a Bluetooth Low Energy connection to interact with other devices.

You can program micro:bit using several languages: MicroPython, C++ or JavaScript. This tutorial will focus on programming micro:bit using
MicroPython, but if you already are familiar with Python, or you're looking for extra challenge, look at the section for `programming micro:bit with other laguages`_. 
C/C++ might be useful in particular, as it's the main language used to program the embedded devices.

MicroPython is a version of Python_ , that's designed to run on microcontrollers like micro:bit. Programming in Python is basically 
writing a series of steps to be executed (it's an *imperative* language), as you will see later when writing your first program.

The following sections will walk you through coding using micro:bit, including basics of programming and micro:bit's features. Feel free to skip over the parts you are 
confident in and choose the parts that you need.
